   It provides methods to manage the increasing complexity of software systems.
 + Efficiency and productivity:
   It optimizes the development process, reducing costs and time.
 + Innovation:

   It makes possible the creation of new technologies and applications.

- Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 We have : 

 Craft Programming, Software Crisis and Structured Software Engineering.
1- Craft Programming (1950s-1960s)
   + Software was made in a casual way, without set rules.
   + Programmers knew a lot about hardware, and focused on solving specific problems.
   + There weren't standard ways of doing things, and code wasn't reused much.
2- Software Crisis (late 1960s - early 1970s)
   + Software projects became very complicated, leading to cost overruns, delays, and quality problems.
   + It became clear that engineering methods were needed to handle software complexity.
3- Structured Software Engineering (1970s-1980s)
   + The focus shifted to organized methods, like top-down design and structured programming.
   *+Concepts such as data flow diagrams and structured programming languages (like Pascal, C) were introduced.
   + Project management and documentation improved.

- List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a series of structured steps used to plan, design, build, test, and release software:Requirements Analysis,Design,Development,Testing,Maintenance.

 Here are the main phases:
 1- Requirements Analysis:
    Clearly define the software's goals and user needs.
 2- Design:
    Create the software's structure, user interfaces, and databases.
 3- Development:
    Write the software's code following the design specifications.
 4- Testing:
    Check that the software works correctly and without errors.
 5- Deployment:
    Put the software into use so users can access it.
 6- Maintenance:
    Keep the software running smoothly, fix bugs, and add new features.
This process helps ensure the software is built efficiently and meets user expectations.

- Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Summary:

The developer writes code and builds the software.

The QA engineer tests and ensures quality.

The project manager organizes and leads the team.

- Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

+ Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help software engineers work faster and more 
  efficiently because they provide many tools and extensions to make tasks 
  quicker and more organized. For example, VS Code.

+ Version control allows tracking the different stages of a deployed or ongoing software project.
  It helps maintain stable versions, fix bugs, and enables a team to work on a project simultaneously.
  An example is Git, which can be used with platforms like GitHub or GitLab for hosting versions.

- What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers face many challenges, including:
 + Increasing complexity: Software is becoming increasingly complex, making development and maintenance difficult.
 + Changing requirements: User needs evolve rapidly, forcing engineers to constantly adapt.
 + Security: Software is increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks, requiring constant vigilance.
